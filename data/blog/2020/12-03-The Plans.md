# The Plans

During November 2020 and some of December 2020 I was unemployed (between jobs). During that time I thought I would attempt to solve a few problems with my programming skills. Since it's been some time since I last created a project from scratch I knew this would be fun as well as keep me busy during my time out of work.

## How StaticGenie came about

Over the many years I've been involved in tech. I've often crossed paths with WordPress (yuk). I always felt wordpress was overkill for the majority of use cases that use it. This was further confirmed by how many security issues (often stemming from plugins) would occur within wordpress and its ecosystem. I believed there must be a better way of creating such "simple" websites like blogs these days.

## StaticGenie was born

Since the majority of WordPress sites are blogs. That simply create what appear to be static websites created by small sets of data created by a handfull of authors. They are practically static websites with a complex and slow hosting setup.

StaticGenie aims to remove the complixity and produce a very easy to host and scale static website.

The journey begins...
