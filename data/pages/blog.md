# Page Configuration
config: 
  # Which layout to use from /theme/layouts/*.ejs
  layout: page
  # The location of the file when generated & it's URL eg: /about/index.html
  file: /blog.html

# Page properties exposed to layouts via: `page.*`
page: 
  jumbotron: Blog

# Everything below the 5 equal signs will be parsed as 'markdown' and exposed to layouts via: `page.content`. HTML is allowed (create layouts/partials if you wish to re-use it).

# Coming in the next day or so

Still need to develop the blog plugin. Shouldn't take very long.
