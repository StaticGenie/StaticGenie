# Early Stage Feedback

Since StaticGenie was formed to get me (ScottyCoder) back to designing code architecture and into the open source scene. There wasn't much of a roadmap besides an MVP (being a framework capable of rendering models with views and spewing out .html pages) and no vision as to where this could end up. Early feedback from people helps form such a roadmap (thanks to their idea contributions) and form a vision of where the project could end up. Speaking to and getting early feedback from the following people has and is still helping to shape what StaticGenie becomes and how it achieves value (to users not yet identified - still working on that part).

- Steve Louis Cooper
